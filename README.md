# EDA
This repository contains the code and documentation for an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on bike sharing data and global car data.The goal of this analysis is to gain insights into the patterns, trends, and correlations present in the datasets, providing a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics in bike sharing systems and the automotive industry worldwide.

# Datasets:
# 1. Bike Sharing Data:
The bike sharing dataset includes information on bike usage patterns, user demographics, and environmental factors that influence bike sharing activities. The data has been sourced from [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/275/bike+sharing+dataset].

# 2. Global Car Data:
The global car dataset encompasses information on various aspects of the automotive industry, distribution of the 'Founded_Year' column,Number of companies in each industry and pair plot for numeric columns. The data has been collected from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shiivvvaam/car-companies-in-the-world].

# Key Analysis:
# Bike Sharing Insights:
1. Uncover patterns in bike usage over time.
2. Explore the impact of weather conditions and other factors on bike sharing trends.
3. Analyze user demographics and preferences.

# Global Car Trends:
1. Examine trends in founded year column
2. Discover number of companies in each industry 
3. Pair plot for numeric columns

# Repository Contents:
1. Jupyter Notebooks: EDA code written in Python using Jupyter Notebooks.
2. Datasets: Raw and cleaned datasets used in the analysis.
3. Visualizations: Plots, charts, and graphs generated during the EDA process.
4. Documentation: Detailed explanations and insights derived from the analysis.

# Usage:
Feel free to explore the Jupyter Notebooks and datasets provided in this repository to gain insights into the bike sharing industry and global car companies. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
